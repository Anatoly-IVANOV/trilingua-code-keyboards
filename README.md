**Trilingua Code Keyboards**

# Description

Trilingua Code Keyboards MacOS layouts are for those touch-typing in English, French and Russian — like myself — plus writing code daily, while insisting on typographic niceties and the JKL shortcuts of video editing software built for QWERTY (a long list of requirements!).

I’ve created 2 keyboard layouts:

- **EN+FR Trilingua Code**: combines the English QWERTY standards with French accented letters, specially optimized for coding. It includes an inverted number row for easy access to frequently used coding symbols and with a `Shift` and `Alt` integrates the French diacritics almost like on an AZERTY keyboard. *No keyboard switching required if you stay bilingual.*

- **RU Trilingua Code**: this layout mirrors the structure of EN+FR Trilingua Code, facilitating a fluid transition for those proficient in Russian as well. It still requires some work for a complete replica.

# Project Goals

- **Multilingual Coding Efficiency**: Aimed at bridging the gap between English, French, and Russian in coding environments, these layouts simplify the language switching process for touch-typing programmer-designer-filmmakers who want to preserve the access to familiar shortcuts.
- **User-Centric Design**: The layouts are crafted to be intuitive for both bilingual and trilingual users, minimizing the learning curve and maximizing typing proficiency.

# Installation

## MacOS

- download the release
- unzip into your `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` user Library or `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` if you want all users to have access to the keyboards

## All other OSes

- for now, I haven’t compiled anything for Windows or Linux
- you can build your own variants based off the images

# Special features

- — m-dash
- – n-dash
- → arrow frequently used
- degree symbol (yes, I do a lot of CAD @idelekka as well)
- diameter symbol

# Feedback and suggestions

I’m continuously improving and evolving the keyboard layouts and welcome any feedback and contributions.
